	<p>The Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ broke pre-order records in South Korea, with more than 720,000 units booked in one week, a notable increase from the 100,000 units of
		the Galaxy S7 and 200,000 units of the Note 7. By mid-April, the number had increased to one million pre-orders. On 24 April 2017, Samsung announced that sales of the Galaxy
		S8 was its "best ever". Although it did not release specific sales numbers, it announced that sales of the S8 were 30% higher year-over-year than the Galaxy S7. Subsequent
		reports in May announced that Samsung had sold over five million units. Jon Fingas of Engadget wrote that, although Samsung advertised its pre-order records, sales comparisons
		to other models on the market were difficult due to unannounced sales figures. However, a report from AppleInsider took a comparison look at previous Galaxy S models'
		first-month sales, writing that the Galaxy S7 saw 7-9 million units shipped in its first month, and the Galaxy S4 sold 10 million. The publication further wrote that
		"Each year since reaching Peak Galaxy in 2014, Samsung has floated the idea that its new model has outpaced sales, shipments (or sometimes "preorders") of the previous
		edition, but in reality Galaxy S sales—and subsequently Samsung Mobile profits—have actually never recovered since the Galaxy S4".
