	<h4>Hardware:</h4>
		 <p>The Galaxy S8 and S8+ both feature 1440p OLED displays, with an 18.5:9 aspect ratio taller than the 16:9 ratio used by the majority of smartphones; the S8 has a
		 5.8-inch panel, while the S8+ uses a larger 6.2-inch panel. The displays on both devices curve along the side bezels of the device, with minimal bezels that Samsung
		 markets as an "Infinity Display", and the display panel itself has rounded edges. They use DCI-P3, offering what screen-testing website DisplayMate describes as the
		 largest native color gamut, highest peak brightness, highest contrast rating in ambient light, highest screen resolution, lowest reflectance, and highest contrast ratio.
		 The S8 features an octa-core Exynos system-on-chip and 4 GB of RAM; models in North American markets utilize the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 instead.
		 Both chips are manufactured by Samsung with a 10 nm process. They contain 64 GB of internal storage, expandable via microSD card. The Galaxy S8 is one of the first
		 smartphones to support Bluetooth 5, supporting new capabilities such as connecting two wireless headphones to the device at once. It is also bundled with Harman AKG earbuds.
		 Both smartphones have improved satellite navigation over the predecessors by including Galileo receivers. In the United States, the devices are available in black, gray and
		 silver color options, whereas gold and blue are available internationally. The blue option was made available in the U.S. in July 2017.
	 	 </p>
		 <p>Unlike past Galaxy S series models, the S8 line does not feature physical navigation keys, electing to use on-screen keys instead. However, unlike other implementations,
			 the home button can still be activated if it is hidden or the screen is off. The S8's display features pressure sensitivity limited to the home button. To prevent the
			 home button from burn-in damage, its position moves slightly. While The Verge claims that the S8 uses exactly the same 12-megapixel rear camera as the S7, though with
			 software improvements, a report from PhoneArena claims that the phones carry new, custom camera modules. The front-facing camera was upgraded to an 8-megapixel sensor
			 with autofocus. The S8 features fingerprint and iris scanners; the fingerprint reader is relocated to the rear of the device, next to the camera, due to the removal of
			 the physical home button. In addition to an iris scanner, the S8 also features face-scanning as an option to unlock the phone. Face recognition technology had previously
			 been implemented in earlier models since the Galaxy S III.
		  </p>
			<p>The S8 and S8+ use non-removable 3000 and 3500 mAh batteries respectively; Samsung stated that it had engineered the batteries to retain their capacity for a longer
				period of time than previous models. The S8 supports AirFuel Inductive (formerly PMA) and Qi wireless charging standards. Due to the recalls of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7,
				Samsung said in a press conference it is committed to stricter quality control and safety testing procedures on all of the company's future products.
			</p>
			<p>Samsung also launched a Galaxy S8+ with 128 GB of storage and 6 GB of RAM exclusively in China and South Korea, and a bundle offer in the countries provides both the
				exclusive model and the Samsung DeX docking station. The unique variant was also released in India in June 2017.
			</p>
			<p>The Galaxy S8 Active features a rugged design and significantly tougher materials, being "shock, shatter, water, and dust resistant". It has a metal frame and a bumper
				to protect from shocks, while the back is fitted with a "rugged, tough texture for a secure grip". Its screen also measures 5.8 inches, the size of the regular S8, and
				has quad HD Super AMOLED with an 18.5:9 aspect ratio, but loses the "infinity" edge compared to the standard models.
			</p>
	<h4>Software:</h4>
			<p>The Galaxy S8 runs Android 7.0 "Nougat" with the proprietary Samsung Experience (formerly TouchWiz) user interface and software suite. The software features a suite
				of assistant functions known as "Bixby", which is designed primarily to interact with Samsung's bundled applications and other supported services. The feature allows
				the use of voice commands to perform phone functions, can generate cards shown on a home screen page (replacing the Flipboard integration formerly featured) based on
				a user's interactions, and perform searches utilizing object recognition via the camera.
			</p>
			<p>Bixby will support third-party integration via an SDK. The S8 supports the use of a docking station known as Samsung DeX to access a PC-like desktop environment on
				an external display, with support for mouse and keyboard input. On 21 April 2017, coinciding with the phone's official retail date, reports surfaced that the default
				music player on the Galaxy S8 would be Google Play Music, continuing a trend that started with the S7 in 2016. However, for the S8, Samsung partnered with Google to
				incorporate additional exclusive features into the app, including the ability to upload up to 100,000 tracks to the service's cloud storage, an increase from the
				50,000 tracks users are normally allowed to upload. Additionally, new users get a three-month free trial to the service, the same as given to users who purchase
				Google's own Pixel smartphone. Furthermore, Google stated that more Samsung-exclusive features will be added to the app in the future, and that the Bixby assistant
				will also be supported by the app. Bixby replaces S Voice, the voice recognition technology previously found in Samsung Galaxy models.
			</p>
			<p>In May 2017, Google announced that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ will support the company's Daydream virtual reality platform after Samsung rolls out a software update
				scheduled for mid-2017. In July 2017, Verizon began rolling out an update for its devices, with support for Daydream. The Galaxy S8 was one of the first Android phones
				to support ARCore, Google's augmented reality engine.
