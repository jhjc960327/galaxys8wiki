	<h5>White balance</h5>
	<p>Prior to the official release, it was reported that some Galaxy S8 displays had a bad white balance, causing them to exhibit a reddish tint. Samsung stated that the
		Galaxy S8 was "built with an adaptive display that optimizes the colour range, saturation, and sharpness depending on the environment", but noted that the device's operating
		system provides settings for manually adjusting the display's appearance and white balance. On 21 April, Samsung stated that the red tinting was purely a software issue,
		and would be patched in a future update. The Investor reported that Samsung would replace the affected devices if a software update did not fix the issue. Updates in various
		regions started rolling out in early May, fixing the issue.
	</p>
	<h5>Random restarts</h5>
	<p>Reports surfaced at the end of April that some Galaxy S8 devices were "restarting by themselves". Samsung has not yet commented on the issue.</p>
	<h5>Insecure facial recognition</h5>
	<p>Shortly after the phone's unveiling, bloggers produced a video showing that the Galaxy S8's facial recognition scanner could be tricked to unlock the phone by showing
	it a photo of the user. In a statement to Business Insider, a Samsung spokesperson stated that "Facial recognition is a convenient action to open your phone – similar to the
	'swipe to unlock' action. We offer the highest level of biometric authentication – fingerprint and iris – to lock your phone and authenticate access to Samsung Pay or Secure
	Folder".
	</p>
	<h5>Insecure iris recognition</h5>
	<p>In May 2017, researchers from the Chaos Computer Club posted a video showing that the S8's iris recognition system can be fooled with a contact lens and a suitable
		photograph of an eye. Samsung told BBC News that it was "aware of the issue", and stated that "If there is a potential vulnerability or the advent of a new method that
		challenges our efforts to ensure security at any time, we will respond as quickly as possible to resolve the issue".
	</p>
	<h5>SMS message reception failures</h5>
	<p>In October 2017, Galaxy S8 users reported on Reddit that they were unable to receive SMS messages, with no fix available and without any comment from Samsung.
